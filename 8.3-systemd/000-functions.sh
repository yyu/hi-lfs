    # However, the new tools should be used as soon as they are installed.
    # By switching off the hash function, the shell will always search the PATH when a program is to be run.
    # As such, the shell will find the newly compiled tools in $LFS/tools as soon as they are available
    # without remembering a previous version of the same program in a different location.

    # Setting the user file-creation mask (umask) to 022 ensures that newly created files and directories are only writable by their owner,

    # new files will end up with permission mode 644 and directories with mode 755).
    #
    # The LC_ALL variable controls the localization of certain programs, making their messages follow the conventions of a specified country.
    # Setting LC_ALL to “POSIX” or “C” (the two are equivalent) ensures that everything will work as expected in the chroot environment.
